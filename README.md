# 📱Budget App

In this project, a budget app has been developed, allowing the user to list their income and expenses (not get saved when the application is closed).

## ‍🤔How to Use the App

The user opens the app and clicks on "Add Income...," which directs them to the next page. On this page, the user can select a category and enter the corresponding amount to be added. After this, the user clicks the confirmation button on the right side of the keyboard, and the amount and category are added to the main page as a list under the "Income" section. The same process is followed for expenses.

In addition to this, at the top of the page, the app calculates the total expenses, total income, and the difference between the two, making it easy for the user to track how much income remains after expenses.
